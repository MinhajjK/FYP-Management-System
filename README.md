# FYP-Management-System
By providing a thorough, unified platform for managing all phases of final year projects, the Final Year Project Management System seeks to solve the inadequacies of current methodologies. From the start of the proposal submission process in the seventh semester to the final presentation for the external evaluation of their FYP project in the eighth semester, students will be involved in the system. With automation and digitization, our system will expedite the processes involved in project initiation, planning, execution, monitoring, and assessment. Our system will enable effective cooperation between students, instructors, and project supervisors by incorporating functions like work tracking, document management, communication tools, and progress reporting.
